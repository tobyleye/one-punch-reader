# One punch man comics reader 
A small webapp i built that helps to read a one punch man comics i downloaded off the dark web (Piratebay), Don't tell anyone.

## Problem
After watching One punch man anime on netflix, i developed a liking for it and i discovered that there was a comic for it. 
I quickly hoped unto torrent to search for it and found one. Problem was, the creator of the torrent, packaged it in one big folder containing folders,
with each folder containing images which represented an actual page of the comics. I decided to create a web app in golang (since i was learning it at the time) that 
would read the pages from each folder, sort it, store it in an array and serve the pages from there. 

## Tools used
Google drive (to store the images/comics)
& obviously Golang
